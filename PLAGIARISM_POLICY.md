# Plagiarism Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the plagiarism policy for the Urdu-to-English Neural Machine Translation project. As an academic and educational project, we uphold high standards of academic integrity and proper attribution.

## Definition of Plagiarism

In the context of this project, plagiarism includes but is not limited to:

1. Using code, algorithms, or documentation from other sources without proper attribution
2. Presenting others' ideas, research, or findings as one's own
3. Submitting this project in whole or in part as original work in academic settings without proper citation

## Project Attribution

This project implements neural machine translation techniques that build upon established research in the field. We acknowledge the following:

- The LSTM architecture and attention mechanisms are implementations inspired by research in the NLP community
- Data preprocessing techniques follow standard practices in machine translation research
- Evaluation metrics such as BLEU score are standard in the field

## Code Attribution

All custom implementations in this project are original work unless explicitly stated otherwise. Where external code snippets, libraries, or techniques have been used:

1. They are clearly identified with comments in the code
2. Proper attribution is given to the original authors
3. Usage complies with the respective licenses of those resources

1. **Contributors** must properly attribute any external resources used in their contributions
2. **Users** who adapt or build upon this project must provide proper attribution according to the MIT License and the citation guidelines in [CITATION.md](CITATION.md)
3. **Academic Users** should cite this project appropriately in their academic work

## Reporting Concerns

If you believe any part of this project inappropriately uses content without attribution, please contact the project author with specific details about:

1. The content in question
